Hotel Management System

Overview

The Hotel Management System is a simple program that allows users to:

Check available rooms

Book a room

Display hotel data

Search for data (commented-out functionality)


The system is implemented with a structured approach, using functions to manage different tasks efficiently.

Features

Visit Hotel: Displays the number of available rooms in each class.

Book a Room: Prompts the user for their name, number of days they want to stay, and room type. It then calculates the total bill and updates room availability.

Exit Program: Displays the final data before closing.


Functionality

1. The program starts by defining necessary variables and initializing an output file.


2. A main menu is displayed with three options:

Visit Hotel

Book a Room

Exit Program



3. Based on the user's input:

If they choose to visit the hotel, the visitHotel function is called to show room availability.

If they choose to book a room, the bookRoom function records their details, calculates the bill, and updates room availability.

The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit, at which point the showData function displays the recorded information.




Installation & Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.


2. Compile and run the program using an appropriate compiler (if applicable).


3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system.



Future Enhancements

Implement a search feature to find guest data by name.

Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.

Include payment processing integration.
